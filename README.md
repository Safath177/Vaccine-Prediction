# Vaccine Usage Prediction Application

## Overview
This application predicts whether an individual should take the **H1N1 vaccine** based on various factors such as **awareness, risk factors, and personal information**. It also provides **visualization charts** to identify areas where the vaccination campaign needs improvement for better efficiency.

The project is built using **Streamlit** and employs a **logistic regression model** for prediction.

## Features
- **Predictive Model**: Uses logistic regression to determine vaccine necessity.
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs highlight campaign effectiveness.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- **H1N1 awareness levels**
- **Risk factors**
- **Personal information of individuals**
- **Vaccination status**

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** (for web application)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning)

## Visualizations
The application provides insights into:
- Vaccination rates across different demographics
- Effectiveness of awareness campaigns
- Risk factor analysis
## Future Improvements
- Enhance model accuracy with additional features.
- Implement other machine learning models for comparison.
- Improve UI/UX for better user interaction.
